delaunay
========

This is a java implementation of the Delaunay triangulation as described in Numerical Recipes, Third Edition.  I developed
this code while working at Stanford University as a research project that was part of clustering ideas for flow
cytometry data.  It uses randomly-generated data and creates an html file, delaunay.html, that uses javascript to
render the data
